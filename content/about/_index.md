<img class="about-profile" src="./jakub.png">

I am a product-minded engineer. I have a strong background in theoretical computer science and mathematics. 

I am interested in building solutions that solve important customer problems. I advocate for a thoughtful decision process because everything is a tradeoff. I also believe reliability is a feature for both customers and a healthy development team. 

During my career, I served in multiple roles in the software development life cycle. I have experience as an engineer, tech lead, and team lead. 

I value honesty, transparency, and candid feedback. I bring a growth and collaboration mindset and help team members to perform at their best.
