System design interviews are a crucial component of the technical interview process, particularly for evaluating senior and staff+ candidates. When conducted effectively, this type of interview enables exceptional candidates to truly shine. As such, it's important to keep in mind that the interview should not only validate a candidate's knowledge and experience, but also allow them to showcase their passion, drive for technology, and technical leadership skills.

Conducting a successful system design interview can be an intricate and challenging process, even for experienced interviewers with strong technical skills. It's essential to keep in mind that the main goal of a system design interview is to evaluate a candidate's ability to design or evolve a complex system. This includes assessing their problem-solving skills, attention to detail, communication abilities, and ability to prioritize and make trade-offs. In order to conduct a successful system design interview, it's crucial to have a clear understanding of the role requirements and the company's technical stack and architecture. This knowledge will help you ask relevant questions and evaluate the candidate's ability to work within the existing framework.

However, conducting a system design interview can also be stressful for the interviewer, especially when trying to create a welcoming environment for candidates while still challenging them in a way that accurately evaluates their seniority. To alleviate stress and ensure a successful interview, it's important to prepare well in advance and establish a structured plan for the interview. Due to the lack of structure inherent in system design interviews, it can be difficult to know where to start or what to prioritize. While there are many resources available to help candidates excel in these interviews, there are relatively few from the interviewer's perspective. For this reason, we have decided to share our experiences and best practices in order to help other interviewers navigate this challenging process.

# Goals of the system design interview

The system design interview shares similar high-level goals with other types of interviews. The primary objective is to assess whether the candidate has the necessary skills and expertise to perform the job effectively. Additionally, the interview aims to evaluate the candidate's potential fit within the company's career ladder and assess whether they have the ability to raise the bar of talent within the organization.

To achieve these goals, it's essential to have a clear understanding of what your company expects and what you're looking for in a candidate. It's important to consider the specific business needs and actual problems that the candidate would be expected to tackle in their day-to-day work. As such, it's recommended to develop a set of requirements that are closely aligned with the company's design and scalability challenges.

By doing so, the system design interview can effectively evaluate whether the candidate has the requisite skills and expertise to perform their job. This assessment should include evaluating the candidate's ability to solve problems, attention to detail, and communication skills, as well as their ability to prioritize and make trade-offs. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that the candidate has the technical aptitude and leadership potential to excel within the organization.

We recommend to focus on the following aspects:
* Assess the candidate's ability to build a system from scratch or evolve an existing solution.
* Grade their capacity to ideate the scope of the system and challenge the status quo.
* Examine their ability to make technical trade-offs and compare competing solutions, as well as their capacity to make pragmatic decisions.
* Scrutinize their understanding of the components of a complex system, and their ability to predict potential bottlenecks and find ways to avoid them.
* Judge their technical leadership and communication skills, which are essential for success in any technical role.

# Competencies and skills to evalute

Once you have identified your high-level goals and company needs, the next step is to create a set of competencies to evaluate the candidates. Similar to solving a technical problem, it's crucial to define the requirements to fulfill. We recommend doing this before designing an interview task to avoid creating a complex task with extensions that doesn't allow you to assess the candidates effectively.

Having a list of competencies and skills to evaluate is not only useful for creating an interview task but also for assessing the candidate during the actual interview. We suggest keeping the list handy during the interview, so you can provide structured feedback to the candidates. Additionally, this list can help distinguish between mid, senior, and staff+ candidates. Keep in mind that the candidate does not need to meet all the requirements listed for a particular level. The flow of these interviews is not always linear and can vary with different individuals. However, more experienced candidates should be able to check off more competencies on the list than less experienced ones.

## Categories of competencies

To effectively evaluate a candidate's system design skills, it's important to craft a set of competencies to assess. Conceptually, we distinguish four groups of competencies, which can later be broken down into more granular categories:
* Problem understanding and communication
* Problem solving
* Distributed systems knowledge
* Technical leadership

### Problem understanding and communication
The ability to effectively communicate and establish problem boundaries is crucial for candidates. It's important to remember that engineers typically don't work in isolated, well-defined environments. Rather, they should be involved from the early stages of product ideation and help define the problem to be solved along with its requirements. When evaluating candidates in this category, consider the following skills:
* Clear communication abilities
* Inquisitive nature and willingness to ask questions
* Understanding of the business needs and the purpose of the product being built.

### Problem solving
Being able to deliver and accomplish tasks is a key characteristic of strong engineers. They possess the ability to tackle problems, persist through difficulties, and find solutions. It's null until you ship it. In order to assess this competency during the interview process, here are some things to keep in mind:
* Tasks should be designed with multiple stages or extensions to evaluate the candidate's ability to progress and complete the task at an appropriate level.
* Designs should be scalable and open to improvements, allowing experienced candidates to identify and prevent potential bottlenecks.
* Different resiliency issues may arise, which senior engineers should be equipped to handle. These issues should be included in the task to assess their problem-solving abilities.

### Distributed systems knowledge
In addition to practical skills, having theoretical knowledge is also important in our field. While we may not always use NoSQL databases or advanced queuing systems, it's beneficial to at least have an understanding of how they work, their cost, and benefits. Moreover, we should also assess a candidate's deeper understanding and specialization in a particular part of the technology stack. As interviewers, it's our responsibility to guide candidates and give them the opportunity to showcase their expertise. This can indicate that a candidate is invested in their work and has a good grasp of complex concepts. Furthermore, more senior engineers may have deeper knowledge in certain areas than we do, so it's worthwhile to let them shine and even teach us something.

### Technical leadership
Lastly, it's important to assess the candidate's skills in technical leadership. This will help differentiate strong staff+ engineers from senior ones. Look out for indicators such as:

Their decision-making process and how they choose tools to solve problems.
Check whether the design is customer-centric or technology-centric.
Validate the scope of a problem and predict potential risks to the project.
