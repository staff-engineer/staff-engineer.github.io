Transitioning into leadership comes with one obvious trait. You have more things to do in a smaller amount of time. 
Your individual work becomes more complex, less defined and require from you a lot of foucs. 
Yet, you also have more meetings and more emails or messages to respond. 

How can you stay on top of your work, help your team and have a healthy work life balance at the same time? 
The solution is a work methodology called **deep work**.

# What is deep work?

The term "deep work" was popularized by Cal Newport in a book 
[Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/).
It might sound fancy, but it's meaning is very simple. I'm sure most of you have experienced it in the past, even if you don't know it. 
Simply put, deep work is the ability to concentrate deeply on a difficult problem to get it done efficiently. 

Cal Newport suggests the following, simplified equation for work:
```
Work Accomplished = Time Spent x Intensity
``` 
It makes a lot of sense. The more intense your focus will be, the higher level of concentration, the better results you will yield in the 
same amount of time. The trick is to keep this high level of focus and concentration for a prolonged amount of time. 
Consistently and repetitively - every day, every week.

In this article we'll cover how a little theory behind deep work and also share some of our personal experience with it.

## Deep vs shallow work

There are two types of work we do as knowledge workers: deep and shallow work. Newport proposes the following definitions:
> **Deep work**
> Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that pushes your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.
> 
> **Shallow work**
> Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

Examples of deep work: implementing a new feature, writing a thoughtful document, learning a new and difficult concept.

Examples of shallow work: reading Slack, passively attending meetings, filling out forms.

Question: Can a meeting be a deep work?
I believe it can be. It all depends what you do during the meeting. If you're solving a particularily hard problem toghether and discussing
important matters, then sure it is. On the other thing, if you're participating some meetings just beacuse "you have to" and don't necessarily bring or add value to it, then rather not.
