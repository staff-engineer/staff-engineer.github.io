It's relatvily easy to explain expactions for junior, mid and even senior engineers. Career progression broadens the scope of work and
responsibilites. But it starts to get much more difficult at staff+ positions. The environment and problems get more ambigous, and so the 
scope of work. It's not easy to define clear and measrabule set of expectaions, because staff roles also differes between companies and
their actual needs. They can also vary between different [staff engineer archetypes](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes).

We're going to focus in this article mostly on the **Tech Lead** archetype, which is the most popular in the industry. We will present some 
expectations for staff engineers based on our experience. The list is definitly not complete and there are many very important skills and 
traits a staff engineer should have. We wanted to describe those that are fundematal regardless of the specific situation.

So what are those expectations?

## Get things done

This might as well be applied for the earlier postions. But for staff engineers it gets even more imporatant. Staff engineers have to get 
their own work done and make sure others can do it too. They should help other engineers and teams manage and prioritize complex projects. 
They should act as a "glue" to ensure engineering teams are working and delviering smoothly. They should observe and elimanties deceloper
experience problems and increase productivity.

Some of the examples of geting stuff done:
* Help the team with project management and prioritization.
* Identify hidden risks and dependencies, which could disturb project delivery.
* Advocate with leadership and finding necessary resource to finish a project.
* Find a way to solve a particularily difficult problem.

## Be role model and mentor others
<aligining vectors image>

At some point in a career, you usually start to have a bigger impact through others, rather than by your individual contributions. This 
happens not only on the management track, but also for technical leaders. Some foretaste comes even for senior engineers, but you get a full
experience of it on staff+ positions. 

Yonger people start to look up to staff engineers and even try to mimick their behavior. Basically, staff engineers become role models for
others. That's why it's important to demonstrate company's values and culture through actions. You get the leverage to align people and 
multiple the outcome.

Staff engineers aslo get an opportunity (and obligation) to mentor other people. We consider it a great privilage, to be able to pass your
experiences and your knowledge to other people. Helping people grow and succeeded is very important. Not only you're activly using your time
for others, but also you're increasing the are of impact. We also believe, that during mentoring, you can learn tremendous amount of things
about yourself, efficient communication, setting goals, etc.

Examples, how to influence others:
* Participate or start mentoring program at your company.
* Activly demonstrate company values and culture through your actions
* Review code, documents, proposals, etc.
* Give feedback!

## Communicate clearly and bring clarity

* make sure people understand what they need to work on
* listen carefully to others
* spot issues and miscommunication problems
* explain why

## Bring calm

* stressful situations
* help with prioritization
* again bring the clarity

## Build trust and relationships

* build your credibility, so people trust you
* build and cherish relationships
* approach with empathy to other people and teams
* understand their needs
