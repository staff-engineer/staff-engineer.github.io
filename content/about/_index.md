I am a product-minded software engineer and leader. I am interested in building solutions that solve important customer problems. I also
believe reliability is a feature both for clients and a healthy development team.

During my career, I served in multiple roles in the software development life cycle. I have experience as an engineer, tech lead, and team lead.
I worked at companies of different sizes and maturity. I started my career at big corporations like Google, Facebook, or Zendesk, and move 
now to a startup world. Currently, I'm employed at Superside. 

In my free time, I'm trying to understand the scientifc background behind cooking.

I consider myself to be an outcome-focused software engineer with a strong product mindset. I'm all into end-to-end ownership and clear upfront communication. Personally, I'm also a true believer in quality over quantity based on well-built technical fundamentals.

Throughout my career, I've been involved in the technical leadership for product engineering within IoT, Retail, FinTech, and Design domains for startups and scaleups. I've been leading the CX platform's product engineering facing over 20M customers at Revolut and recently shifted into the Developer excellence aspects of the engineering at Superside in its high-growth phase.
