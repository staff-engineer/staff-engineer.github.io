It's relatvily easy to explain expactions for junior, mid and even senior engineers. Career progression broadens the scope of work and
responsibilites. But it starts to get much more difficult at staff+ positions. The environment and problems get more ambigous, and so the 
scope of work. It's not easy to define clear and measrabule set of expectaions, because staff roles also differes between companies and
their actual needs. They can also vary between different [staff engineer archetypes](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes).

We're going to focus in this article mostly on the **Tech Lead** archetype, which is the most popular in the industry. We will present some 
expectations for staff engineers based on our experience. The list is definitly not complete and there are many very important skills and 
traits a staff engineer should have. We wanted to describe those that are fundematal regardless of the specific situation.

So what are those expectations?

# Expectations

## Get things done
![](./done.jpg)

This might as well be applied for the earlier postions. But for staff engineers it gets even more imporatant. Staff engineers have to get 
their own work done and make sure others can do it too. They should help other engineers and teams manage and prioritize complex projects. 
They should act as a "glue" to ensure engineering teams are working and delviering smoothly. They should observe and elimanties deceloper
experience problems and increase productivity.

Some of the examples of geting stuff done:
* Help the team with project management and prioritization.
* Identify hidden risks and dependencies, which could disturb project delivery.
* Advocate with leadership and finding necessary resource to finish a project.
* Find a way to solve a particularily difficult problem.

## Be role model and mentor others

At some point in a career, you usually start to have a bigger impact through others, rather than by your individual contributions. This 
happens not only on the management track, but also for technical leaders. Some foretaste comes even for senior engineers, but you get a full
experience of it on staff+ positions. 

Yonger people start to look up to staff engineers and even try to mimick their behavior. Basically, staff engineers become role models for
others. That's why it's important to demonstrate company's values and culture through actions. You get the leverage to align people and 
multiple the outcome.

Staff engineers aslo get an opportunity (and obligation) to 
[mentor](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/developers-mentoring-other-developers/) other people. We consider it a great privilage, to be 
able to pass your experiences and your knowledge to other people. Helping people grow and succeeded is very important. Not only you're 
activly using your time for others, but also you're increasing the are of impact. We also believe, that during mentoring, you can learn 
tremendous amount of things about yourself, efficient communication, setting goals, etc.

Examples, how to influence others:
* Participate or start mentoring program at your company.
* Activly demonstrate company values and culture through your actions
* Review code, documents, proposals, etc.
* Give feedback!

## Communicate clearly and bring clarity

Misommunication is often a source of most problems at work (and life). Misunderstanding can often result in poor performance, subpar
quality, stressed people, or wasted time. The role of staff engineers is to bring 
[clarity and alignment](https://alexewerlof.substack.com/p/6-ways-staffs-reach-clarity).

There are a number of things staff engineers should do to improve communication in their teams and company:
* Listen carefully to others and understand their problems and point of view.
* Make sure team reach collective understanding.
* [Start with why](https://simonsinek.com/books/start-with-why/) and explain why we work on certain things.
* Lead by example and improve their own communciation skills. Show more junior engineers this is often a key to success.

## Bring calm

There are going to be some stressful situations at work. It can be either tight deadline or application incident. Staff enginners should
show their experience and stay calm during the crisis. They should take a lead, communicate cleary and help with prioritization. Their role
is to help team members do their work better.

Another way to bring calm to the organization is by preparing for different failure scenarios much earlier. Staff engineers should asses
possible risks even before the project starts. Then, during ideadion or implementation phase, they should systematically review the risks,
think if mitigation plans still work and adjust. The best way to get out of the crisis is to foresee it and prevent it from happening.

So what to do to bring calm to the team?
* Do risk assesment, pre-mortems and anticipate failure scenarios before they happen.
* In critical situations take a lead and help the team solve the problem.
* And again, communicate clearly and bring clarity.

## Build trust and relationships
![](./relationship.png)

Last but mnot least, staff engineers are expected to build and cherish reliationships at work. They should have realtionships not only with 
their closest team, but different stakeholders and other collegeas in the organization. They shpuld listen carefully and understand the 
needs of people and teams. This can help them better identify problems and empower others.

Moreover, it's expected that staff engineers will build credibility and visibility. It's important, that other people and leaders will trust
they can do a good job. Leadership positions usually bring more "freedom" on what to work, offten behind scenes, so it's crucial to keep
stakeholders up to date on what's going on. Also, when people trust you, they're going to be more open and you're going to gain more from
the relationship.

Some ideas how to build trut and relatioships:
* Have regular 1:1s with your team members and other people in the organization.
* Approach with emapthy, listen carefully and try to understand different points of view.
* Build your credibility and visibility in the organization, so people know they can rely on you.
* Be accountable, communicate clearly what you're going to do and what's not going to happen.
