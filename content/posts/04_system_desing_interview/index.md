In the previous article, we discussed the key elements of conducting an effective system design interview. We empasized the importance of first defining the high-level goals and competencies to evaluate. We covered the base skeelton, based on which we can design detailed interview questions.

In the current one, we wanted to focus on the process to create an actual interview task. We will dissucuss what to pay attention to, how to prepare, but not overprepare. We will define an example problem boundries, create an interview task. Then we will propose a scorecard, which could be used to codnuct and evalute the interview. 

And don’t forget that interview is a bidirectional. It’s not just you evaluating them - they are also evaluating you and your company.


# Think about skills you want to evaluate

Firstly, think what skills you want to evaluate, what do you expect the candaidate to know. Consider expecations from different levels. It's valuable to have one interview task for both junior and senior+ canidates, rather than multiple different task. Based on the experience, you can help more or less during the interview - same as you would do during work. Ideally you should have some list of competencies you need. Based on that you will be able to create a targeted task. 

As a recap, in the previous article we mentioned the following core copetencies, which we will use to prepare an example interview task:
* Problem understanding and communication
* Problem solving
* Distributed systems knowledge
* Technical leadership

Let's also assume we are designing an interview task for a typical SaaS company, where we have a bunch of CRUD microservices, SQL databases, and supporting reporting services. 

# Pick the system and problem set

Now, as we know what competencies to evaluate it's time to pick a system to design. We recommend picking something you're familiar with, and have some expertise.  When you know something, you should also have a pretty good undestanding about potential bottlnecks, limitations and resilienccy issues. With some experience behind your back, it's easier later to drill down some details.

We also recommend to not using the "classical" problem names like "design Twitter" or "design Youtube", unless you're actually working at suche a company. be honest with yourself, and realistic about the scale and problems at your company. This interview is also a showcase of your company and it should spark an interest with the candidate. Big classic names also can have a direct connection to book-like solutions, while you want to know how the candidate would get by in real, work life.

## Example
TODO:
  * budgeting app
  * recipe app
  * image/music generating app


# Establish problem boundries and limits

* think what candidates may ask you, it's good to brainstrom this woth your colleges
* plan what to reveal to the candidate, and what to leave them for discovery
* make it adjustable to candidate's experience

## Example

# Prepare a list of potential questions and problems to solve

* first, it's good to target a buy-in design
* then dive into some details or specific tasks
* topics may change depending on the candidate experience
* don't expect everything will go according to your plan

## Example

# Create detailed scorecards

* to be used during the interview
* easier to write feedback

## Example

# Final improvments and interviewer guide

* peer review
* brush up things
* prepare a guide for fellow interviewers
* adjust as you go, but remember to keep it consistent and fair for candidates

# Summary
