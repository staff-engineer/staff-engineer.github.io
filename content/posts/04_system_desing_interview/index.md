In the previous article, we discussed the critical components of conducting an effective system design interview, emphasizing the importance of defining high-level goals and competencies to evaluate. We provided a base skeleton that could be used to design detailed interview questions.

In this article, we will focus on the process of creating an actual interview task, specifically highlighting what to pay attention to and how to prepare without overpreparing. We will define the boundaries of an example problem and use this to create an interview task. Additionally, we will propose a scorecard that can be used to conduct and evaluate the interview.

It's important to remember that interviews are a two-way street. As an interviewer, you're not only evaluating the candidate, but they're also evaluating you and your company. Therefore, it's crucial to create an engaging and challenging interview task that showcases the company's values and culture while also effectively evaluating the candidate's skills and abilities.


# Think about skills you want to evaluate

The first step in creating an effective system design interview task is to define the skills you want to evaluate and the expectations for candidates at different levels of seniority. Creating one interview task that can be used to evaluate both junior and senior+ candidates saves time in preparation and onboarding fellow interviewers. Additionally, it ensures that all candidates are evaluated using the same criteria, making the hiring process more consistent. Based on the candidate's experience, you can provide more or less guidance during the interview, similar to how you would on the job. This approach provides a realistic evaluation of the candidate's abilities and helps assess their potential fit within the team.

As a recap, in the previous article, we discussed several core competencies necessary for a system design interview. hese competencies will serve as the foundation for our example interview task, ensuring that we evaluate candidates based on the necessary skills for the job. The skills we would like to evaluate:
* Problem understanding and communication
* Problem solving
* Distributed systems knowledge
* Technical leadership

These competencies will be used to prepare an example interview task. Let's assume that we are designing an interview task for a typical SaaS company that uses a range of CRUD microservices, SQL databases, and supporting reporting services. This assumption will help us define the interview task's scope.

# Pick the system and problem set

Selecting the appropriate system to design for the interview task is crucial in evaluating the candidate's skills effectively. We recommend choosing a system that you are knowledgeable about and have expertise in. Having a good understanding of the system's architecture and potential bottlenecks, limitations, and resilience issues is essential. With prior experience, it becomes easier to dive deeper into the system's details and evaluate the candidate's thought process.

We advise against using generic problem names such as "design Twitter" or "design Youtube" unless you work for such companies. It's important to be honest with yourself and select a system that is relevant to your company's scale and technical challenges. The interview is also an opportunity to showcase your company and its unique challenges, piquing the candidate's interest. Choosing well-known systems may lead to preconceived solutions based on existing literature, which may not reflect the real-world problems your company faces. Instead, selecting a more relevant system can provide valuable insights into how the candidate approaches real-life technical challenges.

## Example
TODO:
  * budgeting app
  * recipe app
  * image/music generating app


# Establish problem boundries and limits

* think what candidates may ask you, it's good to brainstrom this woth your colleges
* plan what to reveal to the candidate, and what to leave them for discovery
* make it adjustable to candidate's experience

## Example

# Prepare a list of potential questions and problems to solve

* first, it's good to target a buy-in design
* then dive into some details or specific tasks
* topics may change depending on the candidate experience
* don't expect everything will go according to your plan

## Example

# Create detailed scorecards

* to be used during the interview
* easier to write feedback

## Example

# Final improvments and interviewer guide

* peer review
* brush up things
* prepare a guide for fellow interviewers
* adjust as you go, but remember to keep it consistent and fair for candidates
