Unlike most, I have always found participating in the hiring process to be a valuable and highly enjoyable experience. Facing the high-pressure environment of an assessment and learning to thrive in it is a skill worth mastering. In fact, when I was a sophomore looking for my first job, the difficulty level of the interview process was a crucial factor in my decision-making process. I believed that a more challenging interview would place me among stronger colleagues, and my assumption proved to be accurate. Shortly after starting my first job, I joined the interview panel and throughout the years, enjoyed being on the other side of the table as well.

After conducting over 250 interviews in four different companies, designing interview processes in two of them, and successfully participating in dozens more myself,, I have gained extensive experience and insights into what it takes to excel in an engineering interview. I realized that mastering interviewing skills will be a never-ending, yet valuable process. **In this blog post, we aim to share my knowledge and offer you tips on how you can increase your chances to consistently ace the interviews.**

# The silver bullet doesn’t exist

Although it may seem discouraging, there is no single guaranteed way to ace engineering interviews. The reason for this is that [interviews are highly customized to the individual needs of each company](https://www.staffengineer.fyi/posts/03_system_desing_interview/). However, it is possible to identify common patterns and strategies that can increase your chances of success. Usually, the
until the day when AI takes over the recruitment process entirely, interviewers will remain human. Therefore, your ability to persuade them that you are the reliable, teachable, and collaborative candidate they are seeking will be crucial to your success in interviews.

# Make the most of your interview time

Interview processes can be short, making it difficult to fully assess a candidate in just a few stages of an hour or two within a single stage. As a result, interviewers must not only make a decision but also provide strong justifications for their choice. To give yourself the best chance, it's important to use your time wisely and **let the interviewer get to know your strengths.**
To ensure that the interviewer gets to know you, it's crucial to understand the rules of the game. Some companies provide a handbook or expectations upfront, which you should familiarize yourself with and clarify any uncertainties with your recruitment coordinator. For companies that are less forthcoming with information, **it is essential to ask questions and clarify expectations during the interview.**
For instance, during a live coding interview, some companies prioritize a "get it done" attitude and fast delivery of a working solution over test coverage, while others prioritize high-quality code or a robust test-driven approach. Instead of guessing, it's best to ask the interviewer about their expectations. In most cases, they will be willing to provide guidance.

# Be authentic

Experienced interviewers know that it's more productive to focus on discussing topics you know well, rather than struggling with unfamiliar ones. If you're asked about a topic you're not confident in, **it's important to be honest rather than bluffing your way through.** Instead, acknowledge your lack of knowledge and move on to other areas where you can showcase your strengths. As we already established, the interviewers’ time is limited and you want to use it wisely.While some topics may require you to challenge yourself and gradually work towards the correct answer, these questions are typically more open-ended and easy to identify. 

# Showcase the interest

Many candidates overlook the importance of the "ask me anything" portion of the interview, which can heavily influence the hiring decision. This is especially true during the hiring manager call, but it can happen in any stage of the process. Using this time wisely sets apart solid candidates who make informed career choices from others who view interviews as a mere formality. It's crucial to take advantage of this opportunity to learn about the company's culture, business operations, and the interviewer's preferences. **Ask questions that show a genuine interest in the company and demonstrate that you take the opportunity seriously.** The list of questions is endless, but the goal is to make a wise choice and show the interviewer that you are a serious candidate.

# Practise the skills

Just as you wouldn't want to forget how to return a slice serve before playing against Roger Federer in the upcoming Wimbledon finals, it's important to practice your interviewing skills before heading into the job market. **Keep your skills sharp by staying up to date with your industry and participating in interview processes, even if it's just occasionally.** Starting with warm-up interviews can help you gain confidence and become more comfortable with the process when in need.

# Conclusion

Nailing your software engineering interview can be a challenging process, but there are certain key factors that can increase your chances of success. Firstly, it's important to manage your time wisely during the interview and showcase your technical skills and problem-solving ability. However, it's equally crucial to be honest about your strengths and limitations, and avoid trying to bluff your way through any knowledge gaps.

Remember that interviewing is a skill in itself, and the more you practice, the better you will become. By incorporating these tips into your interview process, you'll be well on your way to securing your dream job in software engineering.
