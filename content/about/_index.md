We write about leadership in software engineering. We try to uncover how to become and be successful as an engineering leader. We're going 
to share our personal experiences, challenges we've seen, and skills we learned.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 

It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

I am a product-minded software engineer and leader. I am interested in building solutions that solve important customer problems. I also
believe reliability is a feature both for clients and a healthy development team.

During my career, I served in multiple roles in the software development life cycle. I have experience as an engineer, tech lead, and team lead.
I worked at companies of different sizes and maturity. I started my career at big corporations like Google, Facebook, or Zendesk, and move 
now to a startup world. Currently, I'm employed at Superside. 

In my free time, I'm trying to understand the scientifc background behind cooking.
