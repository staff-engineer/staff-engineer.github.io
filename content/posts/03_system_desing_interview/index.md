System design is one of the most important parts of the technical part of the interview. It helps to evaluate and distinguish senior and 
staff+ candidates. If done well, it allows strong candidates to shine. And this is one of the main aspects of this interview we should have 
in mind. Not only should we validate candidate's knowledge and experience, but also allow them to showcase their passion, drive for technology
and excelence at technical leadership.

This is one of the most challenging interviews to conduct. It requires strong technical skills and consciousness what to look for. And let's be transparent and honest. Interviewers can also be stressed during an interview. We've been there, and during our first system design interviews we were nervous. We wanted to be welocming to the candidates, so they have a good experience with us. We also needed to create
it challenging, so we can asses candidates well in terms of their seniority. It's not easy to do, as there is little structure to this type of an interview. 

There are plenty of articles how to ace an interview as a candidate, but very little from the interviewer's perspective. That's why we decided to share our experience and best practices.

# Goals of the system design interview

High level goals of the system desing interview are shared with other interviews. We want to asses if the candaidate would be able to do their job. Next, we want to know how they fit into our career ladder level. Last but not least asses if they would raise the bar of talents.

With high level goals in mind, let's get down to specifics. First and foremost, you need to know what your company expects and look for. Not every company needs to design systems at Google scale. We strongly recommend to think about your company's business needs and actual problems. Try to come up with a with a set of requirems very close to your day to day design and scalability problems. This interview should help you asses if the candidate can do their job well.

We recommend to focus on the following aspects:
* Assesses the ability to build the system from scratch* or evolve the existing solution.
* Ideate the scope, and challenge status quo.
* Evaluate technical trade-offs, ability to compare competing solutions, make pragmatic decisions
* Understand the components of a more complex system, predict potential bottlnecks and find a way to avoid them
* Showacase technical leadrship and communciation skills.

# Competencies and skills to evalute

When you know you high level goals and company needs it's time to craft a set of competencies to evalute. Same as working on a technical problem, it's important to define the set of requirements to fulfill. We recommend to do it before desiging an interview task. The last thing you would want to happen is create a complex task with extensions, which doesn't allow you to asses candidates.

The list of competencies and skills to evalute is helpful not only to craft an interview task, but also to asses a candidate during the actual interview. We advise to keep it at hand during the interiew, so you can provide stuctured feedback for the candidates. This list should also allow you to distinguish between mid, senior and staff+ candidates. Remember taht the candidate doesnâ€™t need to match all listed requirements for certain level. Those interviews don't always have a linear flow, so they can look differentialy with different set of people. Howevewer stronger people should be able to "check off" more one hte list, than less experienced.

## Categories of competencies

Conceptually, we distinguish 4 groups of competencies, which can later be broken down into more granular:
* problem understanding and communication
* problem solving
* distributed systems knowledge
* technical leadership

What do we expect to see from candidates?
### Problem understanding and communication
First and fore most, we need candidates which can communicate cleraly and establish problem boundries. In most situations, engineers don't work in isolated, very well-defined environments. We advocate that engineers should be present from an early stage of product ideation and help define problem to solve, together with requirements. Skills to watch out in the category:
* Ability to share thoughts clearly
* Asking questions and being curious what we build
* Understanding what we build, why and for what are the business needs

### Problem solving
One of the crucial skills of strong engineers is getting things done. No matter what difficulties there are, they find a way to solve a problem. They don't give up when they're stuck, but find a way to overcome obstacles. It's null until you ship it.
* Usually there are going to be multiple stages or extensions of the task. Depending on the candidate's experience you may expect them to reach at at a certain point.
* The design should be scalable and open for improvments. Experienced candidates should be able to prevent potential bottlnecks and find a way to solve them.
* There might be different resiliency issues, which senior engineers should be able to solve.

### Distributed systems knowledge
Some theoretical knowldege is also an important aspect of our jobs. Maybe we don't always use NoSQL databases, or advanced queuing, but it's good to at leas understand how to use them, what is the cost and what benefits. In addition, we should look for some deeper understanding and specialization of a part of the technology stack. It's our job as an interviewer to guide and allow a candidate to shine. This can show, that a candidate spends enough time t understand what they're doing and can understand more complex concets. Especially more senior engineers can have deeper expertise in some areas than you. Let them go and see if they can teach you something.

### Technical leadership
Last but not least, try to asses the candidates skills across technical leadership. This can help you distinguish strong staff+ engineers from senior ones. Watch out for indicators like:
* The decisions process and how they choose tools to solve problems
* Check if design is customer-centric or technology-centric.
* Validating the scope of a problem and predicting potential risks to the project

In one of the future articles, we're going to present an example competencies scorecard, as well as and example interview task. 

4. Pick and prepare a system 
  * something you know and understand well
  * split into increments and outline potential interview framework (not that candaidates may not follow this exactly and it's fine)
  * think about limitations, use cases, current and future load
5. Document it and improve
  * document and introduce other interviewers
  * good to conduct in pairs
6. Summuary
  * detailed example with scorecards to follow
