It's relatively easy to explain expectations for junior, mid, and even senior engineers. But it starts to get much harder at staff+ 
positions. Career progression broadens the scope of work andresponsibilities. The environment and problems get more ambiguous. It's not easy
to define a clear and measurable set of expectations, because staff roles also differ between companies and
their actual needs. They can also vary between different [staff engineer archetypes](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes).

In the article, we will focus mostly on the **Tech Lead** archetype, which is the most popular in the industry. We will present some 
expectations for staff engineers based on our experience. The list is not complete and there are many very important skills and 
traits a staff engineer should have. We wanted to describe those that are fundamental regardless of the specific situation.

# So what are those expectations?

## Get things done

This might as well be applied to the earlier positions. But for staff engineers, it gets even more important. Staff engineers have to get 
their own work done and make sure others can do it too. They should help other engineers and teams manage and prioritize complex projects. 
They should act as a "glue" to ensure engineering teams are working and delivering smoothly. They should observe and eliminates the developer
experience problems and increase productivity.

Some of the examples of getting stuff done:
* Help the team with project management and prioritization.
* Identify hidden risks and dependencies, which could disturb project delivery.
* Advocate with leadership and find the necessary resource to finish a project.
* Find a way to solve a particularly difficult problem.

## Be a role model and mentor others

At some point in a career, you usually start to have a bigger impact through others, rather than by your individual contributions. This 
happens not only on the management track but also for technical leaders. Some foretaste comes even for senior engineers, but you get a full
experience of it in staff+ positions. 

Younger people start to look up to staff engineers and even try to mimic their behavior. Staff engineers become role models for
others. That's why it's important to demonstrate the company's values and culture through actions. They get the leverage to align people and 
multiply the outcome.

Staff engineers also get an opportunity (and obligation) to 
[mentor](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/developers-mentoring-other-developers/) other people. We consider it a great privilege, to be 
able to pass your experiences and your knowledge to other people. Helping people grow and succeed is very important. Not only you're 
actively using your time for others, but also you're increasing the area of impact. We also believe, that during mentoring, you can learn 
a tremendous amount of things about yourself, efficient communication, setting goals, etc.

Examples, of how to influence others:
* Participate in or start a mentoring program at your company.
* Actively demonstrate company values and culture through your actions
* Review code, documents, proposals, etc.
* Give feedback!

## Communicate clearly and bring clarity

Miscommunication is often a source of most problems at work (and in life). Misunderstanding can result in poor performance, subpar
quality, stressed people, or wasted time. The role of staff engineers is to bring 
[clarity and alignment](https://alexewerlof.substack.com/p/6-ways-staffs-reach-clarity).

There are several things staff engineers should do to improve communication in their teams and company:
* Listen carefully to others and understand their problems and point of view.
* Make sure the team reaches a collective understanding.
* [Start with why](https://simonsinek.com/books/start-with-why/) and explain why we work on certain things.
* Lead by example and improve their communication skills. Show more junior engineers this is often a key to success.

## Bring calm

There are going to be some stressful situations at work. It can be either a tight deadline or an application incident. Staff engineers should
show their experience and stay calm during the crisis. They should take a lead, communicate clearly and help with prioritization. Their role
is to help team members do their work better.

Another way to bring calm to the organization is by preparing for different failure scenarios much earlier. Staff engineers should assess
possible risks even before the project starts. Then, during the ideation or implementation phase, they should systematically review the risks,
think if mitigation plans still work, and adjust. The best way to get out of the crisis is to foresee it and prevent it from happening.

So what to do to bring calm to the team?
* Do a risk assessment, and pre-mortems and anticipate failure scenarios before they happen.
* In critical situations take a lead and help the team solve the problem.
* And again, communicate clearly and bring clarity.

## Build trust and relationships
![](./relationship.png)

Last but not least, staff engineers are expected to build and cherish relationships at work. They should have relationships not only with 
their closest team, but different stakeholders and other colleagues in the organization. They should listen carefully and understand the 
needs of people and teams. This can help them better identify problems and empower others.

Moreover, it's expected that staff engineers will build credibility and visibility. It's important, that other people and leaders will trust
they can do a good job. Leadership positions usually bring more "freedom" on what to work, often behind scenes, so it's crucial to keep
stakeholders up to date on what's going on. Also, when people trust you, they're going to be more open and you're going to gain more from
the relationship.

Some ideas on how to build trust and relationships:
* Have regular 1:1s with your team members and other people in the organization.
* Approach with empathy, listen carefully, and try to understand different points of view.
* Build your credibility and visibility in the organization, so people know they can rely on you.
* Be accountable, and communicate clearly what you're going to do and what's not going to happen.

# Summary
To recap, we went through 5 expectations towards staff engineers. The list is non-exhaustive but contains skills and traits we consider 
important for staff engineers. We have also mentioned some ideas, on how you could exhibit them at your workplace.

Those expectations can be also useful for engineers looking forward to the promotion to the staff engineer level. We believe that to land
this big promotion, you need to show evidence of performing on a staff level and therefore meeting those expectations.
