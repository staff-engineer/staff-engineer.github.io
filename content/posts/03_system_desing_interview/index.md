System design is one of the most important parts of the technical part of the interview. It helps to evaluate and distinguish senior and 
staff+ candidates. If done well, it allows strong candidates to shine. And this is one of the main aspects of this interview we should have 
in mind. Not only should we validate candidate's knowledge and experience, but also allow them to showcase their passion, drive for technology
and excelence at technical leadership.

This is one of the most challenging interviews to conduct. It requires strong technical skills and consciousness what to look for. And let's be transparent and honest. Interviewers can also be stressed during an interview. We've been there, and during our first system design interviews we were nervous. We wanted to be welocming to the candidates, so they have a good experience with us. We also needed to create
it challenging, so we can asses candidates well in terms of their seniority. It's not easy to do, as there is little structure to this type of an interview. 

There are plenty of articles how to ace an interview as a candidate, but very little from the interviewer's perspective. That's why we decided to share our experience and best practices.


2. Goals of the sys design interview
  * High level goals the same as for all interviews
  * Would the candidate be able to do their job
  * Which of our career levels does the candidate fit best into career ladder levels
  * Would the candidate raise our bar of talents
3. Competencies and skills to evalute
  * problem understanding
  * getting it done
  * distributed systems knowledge
  * technical leadership
4. Pick and prepare a system 
  * something you know and understand well
  * split into increments and outline potential interview framework (not that candaidates may not follow this exactly and it's fine)
  * think about limitations, use cases, current and future load
5. Document it and improve
  * document and introduce other interviewers
  * good to conduct in pairs
6. Summuary
  * detailed example with scorecards to follow
