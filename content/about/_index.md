I am a product-minded software engineer and leader. I am interested in building solutions that solve important customer problems. I also
believe reliability is a feature both for clients and a healthy development team.

During my career, I served in multiple roles in the software development life cycle. I have experience as an engineer, tech lead, and team lead.
I worked at companies of different sizes and maturity. I started my career at big corporations like Google, Facebook, or Zendesk, and move 
now to a startup world. Currently, I'm employed at Superside. 

In my free time, I'm trying to understand the scientifc background behind cooking.
